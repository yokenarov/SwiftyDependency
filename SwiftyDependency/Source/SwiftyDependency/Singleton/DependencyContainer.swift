 This class is a dependency container, it has the functionality to register and resolove dependencies, whereever it is used.  Before a dependency can be resolved, first it must be declared as a class and then registered, otherwise there are preconditions that will crash your app if it cannot find its dependency. Best practice is to register them in the AppDelegate.didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.
 
 NOTE: There is a convinience propertyWrapper called @ResolvedDependency, which is meant to as the name suggests - resolve a dependency. More @ ResolvedDependency property wrapper.
